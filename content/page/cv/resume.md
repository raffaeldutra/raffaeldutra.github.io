**Oracle automation using Docker for development**  
On this case, the demand was build a tool for developers create scripts for Oracle, where this scripts have to pass for some "pipelines" until it get to production.

**Bamboo using Docker**  
Many of our projects we use Docker for build the application developed by other companies. Our main problem was to have the same environment used in development to production, using Docker the problem was solved.

**Shell Script environments**  
In some cases, we could not use some tools for configuration management, so I build scripts for environments to install and configure some tools, like: Nginx, CouchDB, Spring Boot environment, ActiveMQ, MongoDB, Logstash and OpenJDK.
