## Docker introduction
#### Tchê Linux - 2017-04-29

### Summary of the lecture
Docker changes how we create systems. Reasons for your adoption are many, but here is some good examples:

* Embedded application
* Same environments
* Patterns as best practices
* Community

With just a few commands, we can have our application online on the most biggest cloud providers, like: AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, OpenStack and many others. We have an application embedded, so the deployment is very simplified.

During the lecture, we'll use the basic commands to manager docker, and at the end, we will deploy an application on the Digital Ocean.
