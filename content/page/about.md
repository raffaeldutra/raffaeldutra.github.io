Hi, my name is Rafael Dutra, yes, just Rafael Dutra.

I'm 30 years old (January 87) and grow up in the inland of Rio Grande do Sul state. I was born in a little city called Marques de Souza, but I was naturalized Lajeadense (Lajeado/RS), where I lived until 5 years old more or less.

My real history is in Estrela/RS, where I met my good friends, some of them still live in there, but others lives in Mato Grosso do Sul (at least 15 years). This person who lives there was the responsible for made me like video-game, what in that time was a great console Dynavision 4 (or it was 2).

Later, we have a Mega Drive console, whom was my first console and soon later a Playstation 1, what a time, miss that time that never come back again.

In 2008, I stated back college in Security Information in UNISINOS and I stopped it in middle 2009 to live in Florianópolis.

At Florianópolis, I made a big step for improve myself as a man at some points, but the opposite in another cases (I'll never again get lines to buy something or go to somewhere). I met new people, like my new colleagues at college, who made good partners/budies on that 3 years being there.

Backing in 2012 at Estrela/RS, I start to work by there, until in 2015 I have the opportunity to live at Porto Alegre/RS where I live at the moment and work in Canoas/RS.

Death and Black Metal are my favorite music gender, but like everything I really enjoy others genders, like Medieval, Orchestres and Japanese musics, especially when the subject is RPG.

I'm a Linux Sysadmin, my strong subject. I work trying to act on DevOps culture and process/systems automation since 2015.

So, here is not only about technology in general, but about everything that I likes.
