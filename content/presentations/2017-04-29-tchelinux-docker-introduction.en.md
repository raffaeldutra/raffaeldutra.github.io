#### TchÃª Linux Lajeado - Lajeado/RS - UNIVATES - 2017/04/29

### Summary of the lecture
Docker changes how we create systems. Reasons for your adoption are many, but here is some good examples:

* Embedded application
* Same environments
* Patterns as best practices
* Community

With just a few commands, we can have our application online on the most biggest cloud providers, like: AWS, Google Cloud, Digital Ocean, OpenStack and many others. We have an application embedded, so the deployment is very simplified.

During the lecture, we'll use the basic commands to manage Docker.
